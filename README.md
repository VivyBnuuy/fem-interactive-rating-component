Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This one was really fun! I wanted to push myself a little, so instead of following the design exactly, I went with stars for the rating instead of selecting a single number. I added a hover relative to how many stars are being selected, and you can change your rating after selecting one. I also added an error message if the submit button is clicked without having selected a rating.

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM
- JavaScript

# Looking Back
- I learned about currentTarget and while loops on this project - I definitely was a little in over my head, so I'm sure the JS could be cleaner, but I'm happy with how it ended!
- This was my first time deviating from a given design - I thought having the stars to select made more sense and was more intuitive for a user. We're all familiar with leaving ratings out of 5 stars, while 1 to 5 are not as common.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
